<p>HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU!
For The New Year, I wish you a cup full of success,
A cup of creativity
A pint of happiness
A quart of good fortune – both income and luck
A gallon of friendship and love.
May your bread rise high, your cookies never crumble  and may your kitchen always be filled with family and friends, laughter and love.
Everyone laughs about New Year’s resolutions, but I think it is a good idea to think about being healthier.  Eating more vegetables, fruits and grains and good proteins.  Anything that makes you feel better is a good thing. 
Thank you for another amazing and wonderful year!!!</p>

<p>COOKING HINT: The best one I can give you for your New Year’s Eve party, is to:
Measure everything out in advance so you are sure you have everything you need for your meal, several days in advance.
Do as much in advance as you can. 
Take a bubble bath, drink a glass of good wine, wear an outfit that is comfortable, relax and have a good time at your party.</p>

FOR NEW YEAR’S MORNING
FRENCH BREAD BREAKFAST
Challah loaf, sliced ¾ inch thick 
8 extra-large eggs
5 cups half-and-half or milk
3 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
Confectioners’ sugar and pure maple syrup, for serving
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 
Arrange the bread in two layers in a 9 × 13 × 2-inch baking dish, cutting the bread to fit the dish. Set aside.
 
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, half-and-half, honey, orange zest, vanilla, and salt. Pour the mixture over the bread and press the bread down. Allow to soak for 10 minutes.
 
Place the baking dish in a larger roasting pan and add enough very hot tap water to the roasting pan to come an inch up the side of the baking dish. Cover the roasting pan tightly with aluminum foil, tenting it so the foil doesn’t touch the pudding. Make two slashes in the foil to allow steam to escape. Bake for 45 minutes, remove the aluminum foil, and bake for another 40 to 45 minutes, until the pudding puffs up and the custard is set. Remove from the oven and cool slightly. 
 
With a small sieve, dust lightly with confectioners’ sugar
