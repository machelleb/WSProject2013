	<p>Truffles and Trifles started 24 years ago as a dream to share love of cooking and 
	learn how to make being in the kitchen fun. Now, 24 years later, Truffles and Trifles 
	is the largest, most successful cooking school in the Southeast and was recently named 
	one of the top five cooking schools in the country by the Food Network.</p>

	<p>This spring, the Orlando Sentinel inaugurated its first Culinary Hall of Fame to 
	recognize those who have made significant contributions to how Central Florida eats, 
	drinks, and dines. From all over Central Florida, only 10 were chosen for the 
	Sentinel’s first Culinary Hall of Fame. Quoting from the paper, “Long before there was 
	a Food Network, Orlando’s amateur cooks looked to Marci Arthur for tips and techniques 
	on the preparation of all things culinary – and a lot of advice on nonfood subjects, 
	too.” The article was published in the Orlando Sentinel's "Culinary Hall of Fame" on 
	Wednesday, January 23, 2008. We at Truffles and Trifles consider it a tremendous honor 
	to be chosen for the first Culinary Hall of Fame.</p>
