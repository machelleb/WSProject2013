	<h2>~Group Events</h2>
	<p>Looking for a fun evening, morning, or afternoon? Bring your group to Truffles and 
	Trifles for a cooking class. Whether for a brunch class, a luncheon, or an evening 
	party, we can help you entertain your clients, have a spouse program, or just have a 
	fun time with friends and family. We can guarantee a unique and special time. We 
	specialize in Business Team Building events and have had groups ranging from the 
	Orlando Sentinel Editors to Charles Schwab to Disney Directors and spouse groups of 
	every variety you can imagine. We meet with you and discuss a menu that will 
	compliment your group and what they will want to learn. Each attendee will get a 
	booklet with tips and recipes. We can have up to 50 people for hands on or up to 65 
	for a demonstration in our shop. Off premise classes are also available. In addition 
	to our classes we can do amenities for conventions as well as gift baskets. We also 
	do children's parties. We meet with the child and they pick out their favorite 
	menu - including - homemade birthday cake and homemade ice cream. All private parties 
	have a 16-person minimum, including children. Head count of attendees is due 4 days 
	prior to party with balance of monies also due at that time. Cancellation of private 
	parties will be a loss of deposit. If you move your date prior to 4 weeks of your 
	party there will be no penalty. <a href="classschedule.html">Click Here for Latest Class Schedules</a>
	</p>
	<p>If you just want to attend a regular cooking class (see schedule below) held during 
	the week, just call. You do not need a group. Individuals may sign up for any 
	regularly scheduled class. The minimum number of 16 is only required for a private class.
