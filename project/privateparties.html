	<h1><em>Private Parties</em></h1>
	<p>We have a perfect way for you to celebrate any special occasion whether a Bridal 
	Shower, Rehearsal Dinner before your wedding, Birthdays, Anniversaries, Holiday 
	Parties or whatever you can dream up. A private party at Truffles and Trifles is 
	the way. We require a minimum of 16 and a maximum of 50 party-goers. A deposit of 
	$250 is required to hold your date. Once you have chosen a date, we will e-mail you 
	a large number of menus from which to choose your menu for your party. A final count 
	of attendees is required 5 business days prior to your event.</p>
	<p>We understand that sometimes things happen, but if you cancel a party within a 
	four-week period of that event, you will lose your deposit.  If you change four 
	weeks outside that date, there will be no extra charge.  Please be sure you have 
	enough guests before selection of a date.  We do have groups that do not have enough 
	guests but choose to pay for the minimum 16, and that is fine.</p>
	
	<h2>Children Parties</h2>
	<p>Create a lifetime memory for your child. One of the most fun things we do are the 
	parties we do for the kids. They pick their favorite foods—from soup to nuts. They 
	make their own birthday cake and ice cream. We have children who come back every year!</p>
	<p>Children's parties are available for ages 7-18.</p>
	<p>Minimum number of children: 16</p>
	<p>Maximum number of attendees: 35</p>
	<p>For ages 7-13—$37 per child</p>
	<p>For ages 14 to 18—$39 per child.</p>
