	<!-- Site intent -->
	<h3>Site Intent</h3>
	<p>The object of this redesign is to improve the IA (Information Architecture).
	This will allow for a better UI (User Interface). The information will be condensed
	from the 12 pages down to 6 pages.</p>
	The focus will be to manipulate proper labeling and sorting so that users will be able
	to browse and/or search more efficiently without being overwhelmed with excessive and
	repetitive information. Also each pages needs to provide more consistency with the
	sites main objective.</p>
	
	<!-- Competitive Analysis -->
	<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
	<p>After viewing the competitors sites there are a few things that need to incorporated
	into the Truffles and Trifles site. All the other sites were more visually appealing
	while Truffles and Trifles looked cluttered. The information on the site is
	unorganized. Each sub-page is also inconsistent with the company logo and the use
	of different fonts for the titles.</p>

	<p> Alexa.com was the only site that provided information about the demographics of
	the average user. The average user is a female college graduate, married with children.
